# EtherLottery Smart Contract

EtherLottery is a blockchain-based lottery smart contract on the Ethereum network. It allows participants to buy tickets, automatically closes when a specified ticket threshold is reached, and randomly selects a winner. Participants can then withdraw their winnings or get a refund if the threshold isn't met.

## Contract Features

- **Owner**: The contract creator is designated as the owner.
- **Ticket Price**: The owner sets the ticket price upon contract creation.
- **Threshold**: The owner also defines the number of tickets needed to close the lottery.
- **Total Tickets Sold**: Keeps track of the total number of tickets sold.
- **Is Lottery Closed**: Indicates whether the lottery is open or closed.
- **Participants**: An array containing the addresses of participants.

## How to Use

1. **Buying Tickets**: Anyone can participate in the lottery by calling the `buyTicket` function. Make sure to send the correct ticket price in Ether. Each participant can buy only one ticket.

2. **Closing the Lottery**: The lottery automatically closes when the total number of tickets sold reaches the specified threshold. A winner is randomly chosen from the participants.

3. **Withdrawing Winnings**: After the lottery is closed, participants can withdraw their winnings by calling the `withdraw` function. Your winnings will be transferred to your address.

4. **Refunding**: If the threshold is not reached, participants can request a refund by calling the `refund` function. Your ticket price will be refunded, and you'll be removed from the participant list.

5. **Owner Controls**: Only the owner can close the lottery manually using the `closeLottery` function and can also manage the contract.

## Important Notes

- The winner is chosen fairly using a pseudo-random method.
- Make sure to participate responsibly and follow the rules of the contract.
- The contract is open source and does not have a license, which means it's for educational purposes and not for commercial use.
